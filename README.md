# Past Assignments
These are examples of my previous work at university. Currently contins only one which was small 2D game we developed in JAVA. This game uses small library given to us as part of a module. I had to expand uppon this library and make game itself.

I have addditional projects that will be uploaded a bit later. First is AI, complex algorithms assigment where I implemented Hill-climber search and Iterated local search.
Second is from complex and distributed module where I made JAVA application that can be distributed across network and communicates over the network between nodes. It's implentation of ring algorithm although I was introduced to other algorithms as well.

Right now I'm working on my final project. Overall project is combination of machine learning and software development. In this project I'm using machine learning to identify user based on keystroke dynamics data. For machine learning I'm using Libsvm library and software engineering is done in JAVA as it's language I'm most cofident in.
